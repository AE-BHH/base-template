        Day 1: The Sundering SeasWelcome to The Pudding, my little ship hung with true blue sails. She is bravely buoyant upon
        the sundering sea as she bears me questing for proofs among the Isles of Idiom. Aboard there is a crew of only me and my
        beagle Salty. I steer the ship on the heaving waves and Salty listens to my meanderings, understanding my moods with his
        plaintive eyes. You are here too, though you understand much less and exist only in the corners of my reveries.
